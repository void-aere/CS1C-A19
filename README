The provided starter code in main.cpp is a test driver that will automatically
run your bubbleSort, insertionSort, and mergeSort implementations against all
the data files in the /usr/share/CS1D/A1/data directory.

The actual data files are given in the following format

    number of elements in file
    element1
	 element2
	 ...
	 elementN
    
main.cpp will then cycle through all of the data files through the sorting
functions that you have written. main.cpp will then verify that your 
sorting solutions work and display metrics on the resources in time and
memory that were consumed. main.cpp will abort the grading if any of passes
produces an incorrectly sorted array.
